# Campus-shortest-Path
Dijkstra shortest path algorithm used to create a website that allows for a user to get the shortest path from different locations on UW madisons campus. It was created in a google cloud instance so some of the features may not work perfectly under different circumstances. Web app also need to be running to open the site but to see it in action here is the link to video of it working.
